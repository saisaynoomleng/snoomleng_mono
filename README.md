## Architecture

The project is organized as a monorepo containing multiple applications and shared packages.

The application is built as a collection of independent services rather than a single monolithic application. The portfolio and blog are separate Next.js applications, while an Express API handles backend operations and PostgreSQL stores structured application data.

Content-heavy blog data is managed through Sanity, keeping editorial content separate from application data.

The contact system uses asynchronous processing with Amazon SQS and Lambda. Contact requests are placed into a queue and processed independently, allowing the API to respond without waiting for email delivery through Amazon SES.

The applications are containerized with Docker and deployed through a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and AWS infrastructure.
